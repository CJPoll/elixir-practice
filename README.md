# Practice

This repo provides exercises to practice Elixir fundamentals.

For any given module, an accompanying test is provided. It's intended to
accompany the README in my (Learn Elixir)[https://github.com/cjpoll/learn-elixir]
repo.

You don't have to do these in order, but the intended order is:

1. Practice.BooleanComparison
1. Practice.PatternMatching
1. Practice.User
1. Practice.Processes
